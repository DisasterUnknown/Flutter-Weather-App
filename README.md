# Flutter Sample App

This sample app demonstrates the integration of the Auth0 Flutter SDK into a Flutter app. The sample is a companion to the [Auth0 Flutter Quickstart](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/native/flutter/interactive).

## Quick Start

### Clone and install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DisasterUnknown/Flutter-Weather-App
cd Flutter-Weather-App
flutter pub get
```

### Configure Auth0 and environment

- In your Auth0 Application (Web):
  - Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
  - Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
  - Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:3000`
- Create `.env` in the project root (rename `.env.example` if present):
  ```sh
  AUTH0_DOMAIN=undefined.auth0.com
  AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
  AUTH0_CUSTOM_SCHEME=com.auth0.sample
  API_KEY={yourOpenWeatherApiKey}
  ```

### Run

- VS Code: press F5. Select your desired device (Chrome for Web).
- Terminal (Web with Auth0 on port 3000):
  ```sh
  flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000 --web-renderer html
  ```

### What you‚Äôll see

- Logged out: a welcome `HeroWidget` asking you to log in.
- Logged in: `HomePage` shows weather cards for cities in `lib/core/cities.json` using `API_KEY`.

### Tips

- If web auth redirects to a different port, ensure you started on `--web-port 3000` and Auth0 Allowed URLs use `http://localhost:3000`.
- If weather data is empty, verify `API_KEY` in `.env` (OpenWeatherMap) and network access.

## Requirements

- Flutter 3+
- Android Studio 4+ (for Android)
- Chrome (for Web)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On every step, if you have a¬†[custom domain](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/custom-domains), replace the `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `undefined.auth0.com` placeholders with your custom domain instead of the value from the settings page.

## 1. Configure the Auth0 Application

### üì± Mobile/Desktop

Go to the settings page of your [Auth0 application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and add the following URLs to **Allowed Callback URLs** and **Allowed Logout URLs** for Android.

#### Android

```text
SCHEME://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/android/YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME/callback
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that the Auth0 application type is **Native**. Otherwise, you might run into errors due to the different configurations of other application types.

### üåê Web

Go to the settings page of your [Auth0 application](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications/) and configure the following URLs:

- Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
- Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
- Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:3000`

## 2. Configure the SDK

### üì±üåê Mobile/Desktop/Web

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and replace the `{yourClientId}` and `undefined.auth0.com` placeholders with the Client ID and domain of your Auth0 application.

```sh
AUTH0_DOMAIN=undefined.auth0.com
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID={yourClientId}
AUTH0_CUSTOM_SCHEME=com.auth0.sample # For Android
```

### Android: Configure the string resources

In the sample, we are using values referenced from `android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`. Rename `strings.xml.example` to `strings.xml` and replace the `undefined.auth0.com` placeholder with the domain of your Auth0 application.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    <string name="com_auth0_domain">undefined.auth0.com</string>
    <string name="com_auth0_scheme">com.auth0.sample</string>
</resources>
```

 

## 4. Run the sample

Use the [Flutter CLI](https://docs.flutter.dev/reference/flutter-cli) to run the app.

### üì± Mobile/Desktop

```sh
flutter run
```

Ensure you have at least one emulator/simulator running. If you have multiple running, the CLI will prompt you to select the one to run the app on.

### üåê Web

```sh
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 3000 --web-renderer html
```
